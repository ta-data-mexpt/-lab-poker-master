    "Of course in real playing it's 100 times more complex than the scenario we showed you. First, there may be more than one way for you to win. For example, you may eventually have two pairs or a flush, either of which will make you win. In this case you total outs are the sum of the two-pair outs and the flush outs. But make sure you don't double count any of the cards when you count the outs. For instance, you may eventually have a straight flush or a flush, either of which will make you win. In this case you should only count the outs for flush because the outs for straight flush are contained in the outs for flush. \n",

The best you can do is to make sure you don't count the outs that will also give your opponents advantage. For example, afer the flop don't expect the dealer to come up with a pair so that you can have a three of a kind or two pairs. Because the dealer's pair will also give your opponent the equal advantage.\n",
